# Smart Useless Box with ESP8266 and Gesture Sensor

This is my fork of the repository that goes with the Useless Box by György Balássy, please check his repository: https://github.com/balassy/useless-box

So far I only made a few changes in the code (my main remix changes were in the mechanical, and addition of a battery, charger and on-off switch):
- added the ability to randomize the actions of the box, so that they don't appear in the same sequence every time
- some configuration changes for my specific box

The Thingiverse project of my "Uselexx Box PRO" is at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5787968

I'm planning to add some new behaviors in the near future.
